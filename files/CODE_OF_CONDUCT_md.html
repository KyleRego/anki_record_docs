<h2 id="label-Enforcement+Responsibilities">Enforcement Responsibilities</h2>

<p>Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.</p>

<p>Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.</p>

<h2 id="label-Scope">Scope</h2>

<p>This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.</p>

<h2 id="label-Enforcement">Enforcement</h2>

<p>Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at regoky@outlook.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.</p>

<p>All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.</p>
